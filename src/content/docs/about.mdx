How do you scale impact as a leader? Leaders enable the people they lead to
do their best work. And to scale this, leaders must encourage and create
more leaders.

Over my 20 years of experience working in computer systems, I've consistently
sought to grow leaders in my organizations. The opportunities
I've seen potential leaders need to strengthen are typically a combination of
building up their technical competence and their ability to lead (or follow) others.
This site is a living attempt to bring together my experience to help you
close these gaps for yourself and your teams.

You can learn more about me on [my website](https://www.emilsit.net/).

## Inspirations

Everyone's early years are filled with various forms of learning. My parents
were both college professors, and so I was always exposed to teaching
and learning to some degree.  My father built interactive Mathematica notebooks
in the 1990s to help students visualize different solutions, allowing them to
explore the impact of things like different initial conditions. He always
emphasized to me the importance of deeply understanding material, and pushing me
to learn further.

### Technology

When I was a teaching assistant for MIT's Computer Systems Engineering course,
we introduced the concepts of "Hands On" exercises to supplement reading
materials. Instead of merely reading about naming systems, students were also
given an assignment to explore [DNS using
`dig`](https://web.mit.edu/6.033/2018/wwwdocs/assignments/handson-dns.shtml) or
observe the timings of a loop to directly detect the size of their CPU's L1 and
L2 caches.  Active Learning remains an [important part of the course's
philosophy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2_-2KW76ec).

When we look around at learning resources, we do find many many
examples available today:
- The Open Source Society University provides a [computer science
  syllabus](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science) pointing a learner at
  materials and courses that are publicly available.
- [Papers We Love](https://github.com/papers-we-love/papers-we-love) collects key
  research papers for a variety of topics.
- [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org) has thousands of videos and
  tutorials guiding you through evey conceivable topic.

But there aren't many resources designed to quickly get an existing
software engineer to more deeply understand core fundamentals.

In 2012, Bret Victor wrote an incredible essay about [Learnable
Programming](https://worrydream.com/LearnableProgramming/) where he lays out how
much of the way we teach programming makes it hard to learn, and how we might
create an environment to make it easier through visualizations (and many other 
cool techniques).  In 2024, Andy Matuschak gave a [talk titled "How Might We
Learn"](https://andymatuschak.org/hmwl/) bridging together some ideas of
practical learning guided by good tactical structures. His project [Quantum
Country](https://quantum.country) is an attempt to bring in some of those ideas
by bringing active recall and spaced repetition into a textbook format, aimed at
helping people learn quantum computing.

The best person in this space that I know of is [Julia Evans](https://jvns.ca),
whose [wizard zines](https://wizardzines.com) offer deep technical learning in a
friendly visual format. She has [little
playgrounds](https://wizardzines.com/#experiments) that she has built, such as
[Mess with DNS](https://www.messwithdns.net). Part of the goal of this site is
to collect or potentially create more of these resources.

### People

From a leadership perspective, we are blessed in 2025 with many amazing books on
engineering leadership that have come out in the past few years. There are also
great general purpose management and leadership books that have stood out. A quick web
search will reveal many social media or blog posts sharing various lists of book
recommendations for aspiring leaders.

One example I like is investor [Ray Dalio's Principles](https://principles.com/)
book explaining his management principles; what is most interesting to me is the
free accompanying app that enhances the content with case studies and the
ability to favorite and create your own principles.

In looking to build something that bridges the technical and leadership concepts
together, Cedric Chin's [Common Cog](https://commoncog.com/) website is
a clear inspiration. Common Cog is full of deeply researched articles on a collection of topics
all related to driving success in business. In particular, Cedric seeks to bring
together key topics that drive [business
expertise](https://commoncog.com/business-expertise/): excellence at operations,
understanding of markets (your product), and of capital (getting and using
money). This site aspires to bring a similar focus to tech leadership.

Common Cog also explores how to [build expertise quickly](https://commoncog.com/expertise/),
looking at cognitive science research as well as domains such as the
military where people must learn languages or skills very quickly. He
emphasizes the importance of building your own internal mental models
through experience and active construction.

## Bringing it together

I hope this site brings together the concepts above to create an engaging
way for you to develop the skills you hope to apply to take your career
and your organization to its next milestones.
