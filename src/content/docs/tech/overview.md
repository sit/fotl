title: Technical Overview
---

- Key Principles (Explanations):
    - Optimize for iteration speed
    - Target architecture for at most 10x scale
    - Use boring technology
- Architecture: People should create diagrams of known systems and then their own systems.
    - Modularity.
    - Layering
    - Physical vs Logical views
- Technology basics and tools to inspect.
    - OS: Isolation, Containers/VMs
    - Networking: TCP/IP, DNS
    - Security: symmetric, asymmetric. confidentiality, integrity.
    - The web: HTTP, HTML, CSS. DOM.
    - ML: neural nets, backprop
    - Persistence: memory hierarchy. SQL (ACID) vs NoSQL.
    - Concurrency. Locks, races, etc.

- Performance
    - Amdahl's Law
    - throughput vs latency
    - Pipelining
- Programming: You need to be able to read code
    - Functional/Imperative/Declarative
    - OO Patterns. Composition/Inheritance.
- Practical Software Development
    - Testing and test pyramids
    - Logs, metrics and other observability
    - Dependency management
    - Build systems
    - Version control
    - Deployment, feature flags
- Debugging
