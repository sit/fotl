title: Getting Started
---

As a technical leader, you benefit from broad technical strength, which enables
you to rapidly make decisions regarding technical topics.

A strong grounding in fundamentals lets you assess and learn new technologies,
or handle unexpected situations in your day-to-day. For example, although new
JavaScript frameworks are released often, but the functional core needs of web
applications evolve more slowly. When you know how browsers generally load and
render web pages, you can quickly evaluate what may be novel about the newest
framework. If you understand the core principles of certificate chains, you
will be better equipped to debug that SSL/TLS error message.

Similarly in the practice of leadership and management, understanding the
general principles about how to lead people --- particularly groups of software engineers
in cross-functional teams, potentially distributed remotely in different time zones ---
allows you to respond fluidly as new situations arise.

Learning is not linear, rather it is iterative and works best when you are
an active participant. Draw maps! Take notes! Work examples and problems!
