Key mindsets and tactics to use in communication. While nominally about negotiation, there is much here to
say about influence. Communication, influence, negotiation --- these are things we use all the time in
technical leadership.

1. Listen first. (Seek first to understand.)
2. Mirror.
3. Accusation audit.
4. No oriented questions.

Also:
- How to specifically negotiate amounts. Get exponentially closer and do not end on a super specific even number.
